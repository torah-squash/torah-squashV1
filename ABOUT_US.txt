Hello Everyone,

We are team of five Computer Since students from Bar-Ilan University.
This is our final proj. Our mission is to build an open-source startup.

Our startup is a newly game which helps people to remember the bibel.
We are using elements from games like Candy Crash and ext.

Right now, we have a simple game with a functinality of the board.
Our next millsone is in March 2, 2014 so we probably going to give a huge push till there.
