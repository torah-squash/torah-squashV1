How to run the project?

Software
1. You will have to need a local web server on your computer (such as XAMPP or WAMP)
2. If using XAMPP open it and start 'Apache'.
    If WAMP, open it and wait it turns green.
    Pay attention: Skype may prevent the connection to the local web server.
    So, make sure Skype turns off while trying to connect (after the web server execute
    you can use Skype again).

Operation
1. Move the project folder into the local web server directory (~/xamp/htdocs/ for XAMPP, 
    or ~/wamp/www/ for WAMP)
2. Write 'localhost/' + project directory name on the browser and click enter
